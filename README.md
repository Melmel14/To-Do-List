## Overview

### The challenge
This is a customized version of the requested To do app as I went different on design.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned how to play more with Javascript to make the elements in the list to go on each category and do the countdown when an element was deleted or removed from the list, I also liked doing a different style of a form which is more modern without the submit buttons. 

### Continued development

I would say, the next step here would be to add an "Urgency" button ot option so the urgent elements get in red while the non urgent ones stay in black color. 

### Useful resources

- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) - This helped me on finding the drawing images to decorate my page.
- [Wallpaperflare](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/) - This is an amazing website has all the wallpaper in great quality, I used mine as my banner.

## Acknowledgments

This was a long project and for some functions not working fully in JS I checked for help in stackoverflow and mainly google.
